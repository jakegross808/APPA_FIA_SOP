Welcome! 

This is the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for downloading, querying, and preparing data from the Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database (FIA DataMart) specifically for use in the Appalachian trail (APPA) forest health monitoring. Many of the R functions used in this SOP are from the rFIA package.
